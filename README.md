The color palette for WordPress design system (Proposal)

A standardized approach to color enforces consistency and simplifies for WordPress design inspired from Dave Whitley's original proposal (https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/11/26/proposal-a-new-color-palette-for-wordpress/).

This colors tool modified from the open source Color Studio (https://github.com/automattic/color-studio), which is powerful and being used for generating WordPress Color Palette (https://codepen.io/ryelle/pen/WNGVEjw) implemented in WordPress v5.7
